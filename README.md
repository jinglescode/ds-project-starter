# Data Science Project Template

This is a starter template for data science projects; it contains the file structure and presents some codes to guide you. 

*(After you have fork this repo, replace this section to describe your project and objectives. It should be short, maybe at max 2 sentences.)* 

## Introduction

GitHub allows us to manage code and collaborate with others. Not only for data scientists but anyone who does programming for personal or work projects. It is a platform that works as your technical portfolio, a great medium for anyone to read your code and reports. 

For your project, I encourage you to use multiple notebooks for one report if possible. You can dedicate each notebook to a stage in a data science project pipeline. This can be useful when structuring a data science project, as there are usually clear stages, such as EDA and modeling. This makes your project more digestible, as someone can run one notebook for a specific stage instead of running a single long notebook. I'd also recommend saving the data/model at each stage as separate files. Saving them in a folder, then importing them back in the notebook used for the next stage.

Try to keep your notebooks clean and informative rather than filled with codes. If your code is long or complex, it would be helpful to have markdown titles, subtitles, and descriptions for the bits of code. By doing this, your reader can understand why such steps are being taken and what some cells are doing. So try to keep your notebooks more goal-driven and more storytelling. Keep it to more about the steps taken and why those are implemented. Keep the functions and classes saved in scripts that can be imported into your notebook for use. Also, [don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). This does not mean the functions and classes are not important; they are essential to a technical person assessing the quality of your code. So make sure your python scripts are well written and have detailed documentation.

As it is impossible to create a single template that will meet the needs of every project, this example should be considered a starting point and changed based upon the working and evolution of your project. So, feel free to add more files, more functions, and more notebooks.

*(This is where you simplify and summarize everything that is going on inside this project repo. This is where you aim to explain what your intentions were for the project, and you can include the context for why this project is being done. You can detail the structure of your files, the steps taken, and add some visualizations. Provide your readers some background, as giving some context would be highly beneficial to anyone reading. Make sure the descriptions don't go too technical as the README is the perfect place for non-technical people to see your project.)*

*(Here you want to describe how to run your codes, and what packages to install.)*

## Results

*(For those readers who do not want to run your codes or look at your notebooks, you may want to show them the results and findings here. If it interests them, they might find out more from your notebooks. Feel free to show images or even a web demo too.)*
